# ES6 Articles

Blog posts and articles about ES6.

## Naming Conventions

Prefix each article with the video number. Use a single leading zero for articles 1-9. The title should just use spaces as it shows in the video. Note the use of ` - ` in between the video number and the title.

_example:_

- 12 - Article Name.md 
- 02 - I sure love Pizza.md
